They are designed to work well as a team and are fast, agile, and alert. Earlier Coelhomortos incarnations tended to get uniformly slaughtered in the sport, but later production lines were toughened up to make the events more sporting, and since then, they have developed a fierce reputation. Such blood sports are rare in 2090, but the Coelhomortos genome is still popular for more mainstream athletics and are fan-favorites in many of the traditional team sports.
